# Project Euler C++11 Solutions

**WARNING** - Do not peek at the code if you want to enjoy the benefits of Project Euler,
unless you have already solved the problems.

## What is Project Euler?

Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer
programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.
Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of
a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

## Solutions

All the problems are solved with the C++11 programing language. There is no explanation of my decisions.
All the math is inside my head. Maybe some day I'll write explanations for some of the problems.
